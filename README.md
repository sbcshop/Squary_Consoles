Squary Console is the ultimate experience for your SquaryPi and SquaryFi. It is a unique concept to mount any combination of SquaryPi and SquaryFi for an amazing experience. Squary Consoles are modular yet strong enough to hold any combination of SquaryPi & SquaryFi you can think of. You can create any combination such as:
All SquaryPis
All SquaryFis
Combination of any numbers of SquaryPi & SquaryFi


## Combinations

Below are the iamges of how to combine more than one board via using provided serial communication protocols. In this board we have provided two communication protocols one is I2C and other is UART communication protocols.

***Note*** UART communication interface can be establish ***only*** in between ***head-to-head*** Squary boards as shown in the above images, but I2C communication interface can be establish ***among any boards attached*** on Console.
